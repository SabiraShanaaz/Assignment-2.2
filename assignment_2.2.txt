Explain in detail:
* HDFS
* Hadoop cluster
* HDFS Blocks


  *HDFS:
        -It stands for Hadoop Distributed File System.

        -HDFs is the primary storage system used by Hadoop applications.

        -HDFs is a distributed file system that provides high-performance access to data across hadoop clusters.

        -HDFS is one of the important tool of hadoop.

        -HDFS runs on commodity hardware.Eg:Suppose a user wants to store a file of 1 terabytes, 
            the file is divided into smaller units and stored on different machines.
              
        -Thus it is more reliable to failures.Because if one hardware fails the data can be retrieved because it is of small amount.

        -HDFS take the data breaks them into pieces and distributes them to different nodes in a cluster and thus allows parallel processing.


  *Hadoop cluster:
        -It is a type of computational cluster designed for storing and analyzing unstructured data in distributed environment.
 
        -Cluster is a set of connected computers that work together as a single system.

        -The computer cluster used for hadoop is called as hadoop cluster.

        -The hadoop cluster run on low cost commodity computers.

        -Namenode and datanode are used to check the status of clusters.

        -The cluster is made up of racks and each rack contains namenode,job tracker,secondary namenode etc.
        
        -Hadoop cluster speed up the processing of data analysis.

 
  *HDFS Blocks:
        -Hadoop Distributed File System stores the data in terms of blocks.

        -The block size is very large.The default size of the HDFS block is 64MB.

        -When the user stores or uses a file,the file is splitted into 64MB blocks and they are stored in the hadoop filesystem.

        -The HDFS blocks are of fixed size so the user can easily calculate the number of blocks.

        -The HDFS blocks are fault tolerant and they are highly available.

        -The hadoop has different nodes and if a node or a block fails the same block can be read from another node.
